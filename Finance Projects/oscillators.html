    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <div class="section-underline"></div>
    <p>
       The goal of this project is to apply my physics experience to finance by modeling interconnected global markets as a network of coupled oscilllators 
       (think pendulums together on a string). By analyzing key metrics such as the resulting coupling matrix  \(K\), one can uncover underlying coupling strengths 
       between markets, explore the synchronization of markets, and perform stability analysis on the system as a whole. This is not meant to predict prices, 
       but rather probe the dynamics of the system within a given period of time.

    <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
    <div class="section-underline"></div>
    <p>
        Synchronization in financial markets refers to the extent to which the behaviors of different assets or markets become correlated over time. 
        As synchronization increases, the movements of individual stocks become more dependent on one another, reducing effective diversification. 
        This interdependence can amplify systemic risk: a local shock to one asset or sector may propagate through the network, triggering broader market instability. 
        For instance, if stock A is strongly coupled to stock B, a significant decline in B’s price may lead to a corresponding drop in A’s price, even in the absence 
        of new information. High synchronization across markets may thus signal a fragile equilibrium, where localized disturbances lead to global cascades. In contrast, 
        low synchronization implies greater robustness, as idiosyncratic shocks are more likely to remain contained. To quantify synchronization between financial markets, 
        this project attempts to treat financial markets as a network of coupled oscillators whose phase (movement) is governed by the Kuramoto model. 
        The Kuramoto model is a model for the behavior of a large set of coupled oscillators, shown here:
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
    \[ \ddot{\theta} = \omega_i + \frac{1}{N} \Sigma^{N}_{j=1} K_{ij}sin(\theta_j - \theta_i) \]
    </div>
    <p>
        where \(\ddot{\theta}_i\)  is the time derivative of oscillator i's phase,  \(\omega_i\)  is the natural frequency, N is the number of oscillators, 
        and \(K_{ij}\) is the coupling matrix that describes how strongly correlated oscillator i and j are. There are assumptions in this model, including that the 
        oscillators are identical or nearly identical and that the interactions depend sinusoidally on the phase difference between each pair of oscillators. As it stands, 
        my Kuramoto model does not include a white noise parameter and is purely deterministic. Future tweaks and inclusions of noise parameters may be desired or 
        necessary for better representation of the stochastic nature of financial markets.

  <!-- Technical Approach -->
  <section class="project-section">
    <h2>Technical Approach</h2>
    <div class="section-underline"></div>
    
    <h3>Key Components:</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Bayesian Optimization:</strong> Used Gaussian Process-based optimization to intelligently search the hyperparameter space.</li>
      <li><strong>Hidden Markov Monte Carlo:</strong> Sampled from the posterior distributions of the model parameters.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Model Procedure</h3>
    <p>
        This model can take N number of financial markets from the Yahoo! finance (yfinance python package). It has been tested on weekly closing prices for up to N = 10 major 
        stock indexes, including ^GSPC, ^IXIC, ^FTSE, and others. Naturally, a high level of synchronization is expected among indexes, as each index aggregates the behavior of 
        numerous underlying stocks. Testing on individual stocks would also be interesting, especially stocks from a diverse set of industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        Since the current model is purely deterministic, I apply a third-order Savitzky–Golay filter over a 10-week window to smooth the price data for improved fitting. 
        The objective is to analyze global synchronization and large-scale movements rather than local fluctuations, so smoothing should be appropriate as long as it does not 
        obscure these broader trends.
    </p>
    <p>
        After smoothing, I take the logarithm of the prices,  \(log(P_i(t))\) , and subtract the mean across all assets at each time step, yielding  
        \(\theta_i = log(P_i(t)) - ⟨log(P_i(t))⟩). This normalization step mitigates differences in absolute price levels between markets or stocks, 
        aiding numerical stability during fitting. Importantly, it does not alter the underlying Kuramoto dynamics, which are invariant under uniform (vertical) 
        shifts across oscillators. The parameters  \(\omega_i\)  and  \(K_{ij}\)  are then extrapolated.
    </p>

    The corner plot above shows the posterior distributions for each of the five parameters: \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), \(d\),
    and \(\log(f)\). The diagonal histograms show the marginalized distribution for each parameter, while the 
    off-diagonal panels show the joint distributions between parameter pairs, revealing any correlations.
    </p>
    <p>
    The recovered parameter estimates with their 1\(\sigma\) uncertainties are:
    </p>
    <div style="text-align: center; margin: 1.5rem 0;">
        \[
        a_V = 10.369^{+0.040}_{-0.041}, \quad a_S = 13.935^{+0.108}_{-0.111}, \quad a_A = 3.232^{+0.114}_{-0.116}, \quad a_c = 0.497^{+0.003}_{-0.004}, \quad log(f) = -4.121^{0.014}_{-0.014}
        \]
    </div>
    <p>
        Comparing these to commonly accepted literature values — \(a_V \approx 15.5\) MeV, \(a_S \approx 17.2\) MeV,
        \(a_C \approx 0.70\) MeV, and \(a_A \approx 23\) MeV — reveals notable discrepancies, particularly in \(a_C\) and \(a_A\).
        These differences are likely attributable to the subset of nuclei used for fitting: by restricting the dataset to heavier nuclei,
        the model is calibrated to a regime where certain terms contribute differently than across the full nuclear chart.
        The volume and surface coefficients \(a_V\) and \(a_S\) are also lower than literature values, which is consistent
        with fitting to a narrower mass range.
    </p>
    <p>
        A strong positive correlation is visible between \(a\) and \(b\), as well as between \(b\) and \(d\),
        suggesting these coefficient pairs are not fully independent given the data. The \(\log(f)\) parameter,
        which accounts for any underestimated uncertainty in the model, converged to \(-4.121^{+0.014}_{-0.014}\),
        indicating the additional model error is small.
